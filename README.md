An app to help me track my allergy

## Motivation
I have several allergies. I'm mainly allergic to pollen. This app is meant to help me (and maybe others) to track the allergy. I hope to find patterns with the app and to figure out if the symptoms change over the years.

## Contribution

Pull requests are welcome. But I already have so ideas about the UI and the features. So maybe it's beste to wait with pull request until the direction of the development is clearer.

Please add tests to the code you contribute.
